SKU Profit & Cost Intelligence Dashboard

Asset Class: FP&A – Unit Economics / SKU Margin Intelligence
Environment: Power BI
Source Period: As per costing PDF inputs 

Costing

1) Strategic Intent

This asset is built to diagnose SKU-level profitability erosion across the full end-to-end commercial cost stack.

It does NOT treat cost as a single bucket —
it decomposes margin dilution into fabric + manufacturing + marketplace charges + ad bleed + indirects.

This is not reporting — this is diagnosis.

This is the CFO view required for SKU kill list decisions & Pricing Intelligence.

2) Core Problem Statements Solved

SKUs that sell → but don’t profit — are invisible in normal MIS

Marketplace ecosystem fees silently eat contribution

Ad heavy SKUs get optimized by “sales” teams — NOT “yield” teams

Indirect OPEX is not mapped to product-level ROI

This dashboard kills all four blind spots.

3) Analytical Views Provided
Block	What this view surfaces
Fabric / Manufacturing Cost Composition	raw material % of delivered cost mix
Total Marketplace Cost Stack	advertising, selling fees, MFN/FBA charges as % of revenue
Other Indirect Expenses	overhead to allocate baseline business load
Top 25 SKUs	primary value drivers
Bleeding SKUs	SKUs that must be restrained / repriced / delisted
Ad-Heavy SKUs	where CAC > value generated
4) KPIs Used
Metric	Definition
Net P&L per Unit	unit level margin (profit or loss)
Units per SKU	volume leverage check
Cost % Contribution	cost category % share
Ad % of Marketplace Spend	ad burden intensity metric
Marketplace Cost %	non-manufacturing ecosystem leakage
5) How Finance Should Use This
Decision Pattern	Interpretation
Remove SKU?	Bleeding SKU + high volume = immediate SKU guardrail
Raise price?	Minor loss + low volume + high ad % = pricing test candidate
Reduce ad?	Ad share >90% of marketplace stack = ad suppression required
Negotiate marketplace / logistics terms?	MFN / FBA rising = ops negotiation priority
Kill campaigns?	High ad – low velocity SKUs get flagged
6) Governance

Owner: FP&A + Commercial Finance
Cadence: Weekly or Bi-Weekly (marketplace SKU dynamics are volatile)
Source Inputs: Cost BOM, Marketplace Fee Exports, Ad Spend, Indirect OPEX 

Costing

7) Interpretive Warnings

Volume is not signal — unit economics is signal

Top line revenue is vanity — contribution is truth

Ad Spend % >90% = revenue BUYING not revenue EARNING

bleeding SKUs are not a reporting highlight — they are an urgency case.

8) Maturity Curve (next evolution)
Tier	Feature
T2	current – diagnostic margin intelligence
T3	price elasticity simulator per SKU
T4	cost-to-serve integration (logistics, returns)
T5	automated “Kill / Keep / Reprice” recommendation engine
